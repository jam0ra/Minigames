## Games ##
The current games are:
- Guessing Game
  - The user attempts to guess a random number generated by the computer, with a user-selected range.
- Reverse Guessing Game
  - The opposite of the Guessing Game where the user selects a number, and the computer attempts to guess it.
- Hangman
  - The classic game of Hangman, where the computer randomly selects a word and the user attempts to correctly guess it.
- Cows and Bulls
  - A game where a user must attempt to correctly guess a code of n digits, in the correct order, where n is chosen by the user.
  
  ## General Input Tips ##
  - Enter a single input into the terminal line. This prevents the system from misreading inputs
    - Sample good input: ` 10 `
    - Sample bad input: ` 10 20 30 `
